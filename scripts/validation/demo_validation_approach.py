Demonstration of the UTA-STAR Validation Approach

This script shows how the validation methodology proves UTA-STAR superiority:

APPROACH:
1. Use your 3 demo areas as "ground truth" high-risk areas
2. Train UTA-STAR to learn what makes these areas high-risk  
3. Apply learned model to predict risk across ALL other parcels
4. Validate predictions against independent fire risk indicators
5. Compare against traditional fire risk assessment methods

KEY INNOVATION: 
- Spatial preference learning: Instead of asking experts for weights,
  let experts select high-risk locations and derive weights automatically
- Non-linear utility capture: Allows diminishing returns, thresholds, etc.
- Predictive validation: Proves method works by predicting other high-risk areas

This demonstrates your method's superiority by showing it can:
✓ Learn from spatial examples (more intuitive than weight assignment)
✓ Capture non-linear risk relationships traditional methods miss
✓ Generalize to identify other high-risk areas with better accuracy
✓ Provide interpretable utility functions for decision support

    TITLE: "Validating Spatial Preference Disaggregation for Wildfire Risk Assessment"
    
    RESEARCH QUESTIONS:
    1. Can UTA-STAR learn generalizable risk patterns from limited spatial examples?
    2. Does preference disaggregation outperform traditional MCDA weighting methods?
    3. Do non-linear utility functions capture fire risk relationships better than linear weights?
    4. Is spatial selection more feasible for practitioners than weight assignment?
    
    METHODOLOGY:
    
    Phase 1: Training Data Collection
    - Expert selection of known high-risk areas (your 3 demo selections: 271 parcels)
    - Areas represent different risk archetypes (slope-driven, WUI, fuel-driven)
    - Spatial distribution ensures geographic representation
    
    Phase 2: Model Development  
    - Train UTA-STAR using selected areas as preferred alternatives
    - Test alpha values 1-4 to determine optimal utility function complexity
    - Derive criterion weights and piecewise utility functions
    
    Phase 3: Predictive Validation
    - Apply learned model to rank ALL remaining parcels (25,000+ parcels)
    - Create independent validation set from:
      * Historical fire damage areas (Thomas Fire, Jesusita Fire perimeters)
      * Additional expert-identified high-risk zones  
      * Parcels with similar characteristics to training set
    
    Phase 4: Comparative Analysis
    - Compare UTA-STAR against established fire risk methods:
      * NFPA/Firewise standard approaches
      * CAL FIRE risk assessment protocols  
      * WUI risk indices from literature
      * Expert judgment baselines
      * Equal weighting and variance-based methods
    
    Phase 5: Performance Metrics
    - Area Under ROC Curve (AUC) for binary classification
    - Precision at top-K (500, 1000 parcels) for resource allocation
    - Mean rank of validation high-risk parcels
    - Spearman correlation with expert rankings
    - Cross-validation stability across different training sets
    
    Phase 6: Non-linearity Analysis
    - Measure deviation of learned utilities from linear functions
    - Identify criteria where non-linearity provides benefits
    - Compare α=1 (linear) vs α>1 (piecewise) performance
    - Analyze threshold effects and diminishing returns
    
    EXPECTED CONTRIBUTIONS:
    1. Empirical proof that spatial preference learning outperforms traditional methods
    2. Evidence that non-linear utilities capture fire risk relationships better
    3. Demonstration of practical feasibility for fire management applications
    4. Framework for validating spatial MCDA methods in other domains
    
    STATISTICAL ANALYSIS:
    - Paired t-tests comparing method performance across validation folds
    - Bootstrap confidence intervals for performance metrics  
    - Effect size calculations (Cohen's d) for practical significance
    - Sensitivity analysis for different training set sizes and compositions
